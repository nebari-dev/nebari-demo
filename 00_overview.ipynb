    "\n",
    "*Introduce Nebari dev team, and Quansight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Acknowledge that Nebari would not be possible if it were not for all the amazing open-source projects it was built with, Jupyter, Dask, and the countless lab extensions and integrated services, and many many.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This PyDataNYC Tutorial will be 90 minutes and will include plenty of opportunities to explore and play with a live Nebari cluster. Outlined below is an overview of the material covered in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Overview of Nebari (this notebook) - 10 mins\n",
    "1. How to log in and intro to the available interfaces - 5-7 mins\n",
    "    - Interactive exercises - 5-7 mins\n",
    "2. Intro to Dask and Dask-Gateway and scaling your Python code - 5-7 mins\n",
    "    - Interactive exercises -  5-7 mins\n",
    "3. Intro to conda-store and environment management - 5-7 mins\n",
    "4. Intro to ContainDS Dashboards and dashboard sharing - 5-7 mins\n",
    "    - Create your own dashboard - 5-7 mins\n",
    "5. How to install, initialize and deploy a Nebari cluster - 10 mins\n",
    "6. Conclusion and Q&A - 20 mins\n",

    "In several of the notebooks, you might see the following callouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üëÄ Watch this...\n",

    "In these sections, the presenter will demonstrate a slightly more in-depth overview of a particular feature. During this time, there is nothing needed from you other than your attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üëâ Your turn...\n",
    "\n",
    "In these sections, attentees will be given 5-7 minutes to work through a set of basic exercises or explore a particular feature. Feel free to do so independently or with your neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asking questions and requesting assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a question about the topic being covered, please raise your hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into technical issues during any of the sections, please place a sticky note on the backside of your monitor and someone will come around to assist you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is for attendees to leave feeling like they understand what Nebari is, how to use some of it's core features and how to deploy your own Nebari cluster. Ultimately this only works if you're engaged and having fun üòä"

    "## What is [Nebari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai_aesthetics#Nebari)?\n",
    "\n",
    "An opinionated open source [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) distribution that provides an all-in-one development and experimentation platform for teams to work efficiently and collaboratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break that down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nebari is a declarative, infrastructure-as-code approach to deploying and managing [Zero-to-JupyterHub (Z2JH) for Kubernetes](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/). The end-to-end deployment process is handled by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which provides a configurable way of provisioning all of the necessary resources and whose inputs are all centralized in a single configuration file, the `nebari-config.yaml`. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Terraform, a Nebari cluster can be deployed from scratch on [AWS](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-aws), [Azure](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-azure), [Digital Ocean](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-do) or [GCP](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-gcp), or one an existing Kubernetes cluster on most other major cloud providers. Using Terraform also provides a relatively simple and declarative approach to adding new features and services to the platform.\n",

    "The details of how to install, initialize and deploy a Nebari cluster will be covered in [05_setup.ipynb](./05_setup.ipynb)."

    "## Who is it for, and why should you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment approach taken by Nebari allows those with little-to-no DevOps experience to deploy and manage a production-ready data science platform that would otherwise require administrators with expertise in JupyterHub, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure and other DevOps technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the easy with which Nebari can be deployed, it also comes pre-configured with several key features used by data scientists, developers and administrators on a daily basis."

    "## Features and integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "By using JupyterHub as the core service, other applications and features can more easily be integrated, usually added as [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/). Currently a few of the core integrations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access to a shared filesystem.\n",
    "- [**Dask-Gateway**](https://gateway.dask.org/) for access to a distributed, scalable compute cluster.\n",
    "- [**conda-store**](https://conda-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the conda environment management service.\n",
    "- [**ContainDS Dashboards**](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create and share dashboards.\n",
    "- [**Keycloak**](https://www.keycloak.org/) as the identity and access management platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other services and features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**VSCode code-server**](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to run VS Code in the browser (an alternative to JupyterLab).\n",
    "- [**JupyterHub-SSH/JupyterHub-SFTP**](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh) to securely connect to the cluster remotely.\n",
    "- [**Jupyter-VideoChat (Jitsi)**](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-videochat) as an embedded video-chat service.\n",
    "- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) + [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) as the cluster monitoring solution.\n",
    "- [**Argo-Workflows**](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) as the workflow management platform.\n",
    "- [**kbatch**](https://github.com/kbatch-dev/kbatch) to submit batch jobs/cronjobs from JupyterLab.\n",
