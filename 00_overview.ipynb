    "\n",
    "At it's core, Nebari is a [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Nebari is a declarative, infrastructure-as-code approach to deploying and managing [Zero-to-JupyterHub (Z2JH) for Kubernetes](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/). The end-to-end deployment process is handled by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which provides a configurable way of provisioning all of the necessary resources and whose inputs are all centralized in a single configuration file, the `nebari-config.yaml`. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Terraform, a Nebari cluster can be deployed from scratch on [AWS](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-aws), [Azure](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-azure), [Digital Ocean](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-do) or [GCP](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-gcp), or one an existing Kubernetes cluster on most other major cloud providers. Using Terraform also provides a relatively simple and declarative approach to adding new features and services to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of how to install, initialize and deploy a Nebari cluster will be covered in [05_setup.ipynb](./05_setup.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment approach taken by Nebari allows those with little-to-no DevOps experience to deploy and manage a production-ready data science platform that would otherwise require users with expertise in JupyterHub, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure and other DevOps technologies. \n",

    "- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) + [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) as the cluster monitoring solution.\n",
    "- [**Argo-Workflows**](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) as the workflow management platform (Kubernetes).\n",
    "- [**kbatch**](https://github.com/kbatch-dev/kbatch) to submit batch jobs/cronjobs from JupyterLab.\n",
    "- [**Jupyter-VideoChat (Jitsi)**](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-videochat) as an embedded video-chat service.\n",
    "- [**Prefect**](https://prefect.io) as another workflow management platform (Python). *(not default)*\n",
