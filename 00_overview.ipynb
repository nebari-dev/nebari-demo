    "## What is [Nebari](https://www.nebari.dev/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "An opinionated open source [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) distribution that provides an all-in-one development and experimentation platform for teams to work efficiently and collaboratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break that down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nebari is a declarative, infrastructure-as-code approach to deploying and managing [Zero-to-JupyterHub (Z2JH) for Kubernetes](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/). The end-to-end deployment process is handled by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which provides a configurable way of provisioning all of the necessary resources and whose inputs are all centralized in a single configuration file, the `nebari-config.yaml`. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Terraform, a Nebari cluster can be deployed from scratch on AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean or GCP, or one an existing Kubernetes cluster on most other major cloud providers. Using Terraform also provides a relatively simple and declarative approach to adding new features and services to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment approach taken by Nebari allows those with little-to-no DevOps experience to deploy and manage a production-ready data science platform that would otherwise require users with expertise in JupyterHub, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure and other DevOps technologies. "

    "\n",
    "By using JupyterHub as the core service, other applications and features can more easily be integrated, usually added as [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/). Currently a few of the core integrations include:\n",

    "- Access to a shared filesystem.\n",
    "- [**Dask-Gateway**](https://gateway.dask.org/) for access to a distributed, scalable compute cluster.\n",
    "- [**conda-store**](https://conda-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the conda environment management service.\n",
    "- [**ContainDS Dashboards**](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create and share dashboards.\n",
    "- [**Keycloak**](https://www.keycloak.org/) as the identity and access management platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other services and features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**VSCode code-server**](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to run VS Code in the browser (an alternative to JupyterLab).\n",
    "- [**JupyterHub-SSH/JupyterHub-SFTP**](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh) to securely connect to the cluster remotely.\n",
    "- [**Jupyter-VideoChat (Jitsi)**](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-videochat) as an embedded video-chat service.\n",
    "- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) + [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) as the cluster monitoring solution.\n",
    "- [**Argo-Workflows**](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) as the workflow management platform.\n",
    "- [**kbatch**](https://github.com/kbatch-dev/kbatch) to submit batch jobs/cronjobs from JupyterLab.\n",
