    "- **Scalable+distributed compute clusters** with Dask and [Dask-Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/).\n",
    "- **Reproducible, yet flexible environments** with [conda-store](https://conda-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "- You can create and **share dashboards** with [ContainDS Dashboards](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "- Team-wide identity and **access management** with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)\n",
    "- Built with **security and infrastructure best practices**.\n",
    "- Uses free and open source tools wherever possible for **complete customization**.\n",
    "- **Quick set up** in under 30 mins!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other services and features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**VSCode code**](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to run VS Code in the browser (an alternative to JupyterLab).\n",
    "- [**Jupyter-VideoChat (Jitsi)**](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-videochat) as an embedded video-chat service.\n",
    "- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) + [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) as the cluster monitoring solution.\n",
    "- [**Argo-Workflows**](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) as the workflow management platform.\n",
    "- [**kbatch**](https://github.com/kbatch-dev/kbatch) to submit batch jobs/cronjobs from JupyterLab.\n",
    "- [**JupyterHub-SSH/JupyterHub-SFTP**](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh) to securely connect to the cluster remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using JupyterHub as the core service, other applications and features can more easily be integrated, usually added as [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/).\n",

The end-to-end deployment process is handled by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which provides a configurable way of provisioning all of the necessary resources and whose inputs are all centralized in a single configuration file, the `nebari-config.yaml`. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Terraform, a Nebari cluster can be deployed from scratch on [AWS](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-aws), [Azure](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-azure), [Digital Ocean](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-do) or [GCP](https://nebari-docs.netlify.app/docs/how-tos/nebari-gcp), or one an existing Kubernetes cluster on most other major cloud providers. Using Terraform also provides a relatively simple and declarative approach to adding new features and services to the platform.\n",
