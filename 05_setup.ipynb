    "\n",
    "For those unfamiliar, GitOps \"is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications\" (source: [gitops.tech](https://www.gitops.tech/)). This means your deployment is handled by a CI/CD platform such as GitHub-Actions or GitLab CI and that your infrastructure code (i.e. `nebari-config.yaml`, and the Terraform scripts) live in a shared repository that you can share with your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without using a GitOps approach, you make the appropriate change to the `nebari-config.yaml` and then redeploy from your local machine. For this to work, you will need to ensure you have `nebari` installed, your cloud credentials set and that you have a stable internet connetion. This puts responsibility of the deployment in the hands of one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a GitOps approach, you make the same change to the `nebari-config.yaml` but now, you open a pull-request against the repo hosting this infrastructure code. From here, team members can chime in and approve the change. Once everyone is happy, you merge your changes which then triggers a redeployment of your Nebari cluster using GitHub-Actions (or GitLab CI).\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we have made passing references to [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and the ability to grant or restrict access to particular resources and platform features. With Keycloak, administrators can ensure each user has the appropriate access to the resources they need to perform their job duties. This is the idea by the concept of [\"least privilege access\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).\n",
