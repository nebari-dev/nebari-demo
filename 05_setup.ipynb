This means your deployment is handled by a CI/CD platform such as GitHub-Actions or GitLab CI and that your infrastructure code (i.e. `nebari-config.yaml`, and the Terraform scripts) live in a shared repository that you can share with your team.\n",

For this to work, you will need to ensure you have `nebari` installed, your cloud credentials set and that you have a stable internet connetion. This puts responsibility of the deployment in the hands of one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a GitOps approach, you make the same change to the `nebari-config.yaml` but now, you open a pull-request against the repo hosting this infrastructure code. From here, team members can chime in and approve the change. Once everyone is happy, you merge your changes which then triggers a redeployment of your Nebari cluster using GitHub-Actions (or GitLab CI).\n",
