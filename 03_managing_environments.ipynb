    "\n",
    "Either allow individual users to manage their own bespoke environments, which then becomes a pain to reliably share. Or force users to submit change-control requests to update a shared environment, which then usually gets handed off to an over-worked administrator. This latter option may get around the reliability issue but ultimately reduces the speed and flexibilty users need to get started on a new project.\n",

    "With `conda-store` on Nebari, users can be granted access to create environments in their own personal namespace or, with the proper permissions (handled by Keycloak), create and update environments in the global or shared namespaces."
