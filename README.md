> If your server doesn't launch within 30 seconds, this means the cluster is in the process of auto-scaling to meet the new demand. Please be patient, this might take up to several minutes.

6. From here, you can clone this repo in two ways, from the Jupyter terminal or from the JupyterLab git extention.
    - Clone this repo from the Jupyter terminal: `git clone https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-demo`
    - Clone this repo using JupyterLab git extention

7. Finally, open the `00_overview.ipynb` notebook to follow along.

### Deploy your own Nebari cluster ‚öôÔ∏è

If you were not in attendance at the live PyDataNYC tutorial, you can deploy your own Nebari cluster and clone this repo to walk through the several of the high-level features.

To deploy your own Nebari cluster, [follow these instructions in the Nebari documentation](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started/installing-nebari).
