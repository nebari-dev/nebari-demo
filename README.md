> If your server doesn't launch within 30 seconds, this means the cluster is in the process of auto-scaling to meet the new demand. Please be patient, this might take up to several minutes.

5. From here, you can clone this repo in two ways, from the Jupyter terminal or from the JupyterLab git extention.
    - Clone this repo from the Jupyter Terminal:
